# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** September 2, 2025

Your privacy is our top priority. JotPad is designed to be a private, secure space for your thoughts.

- **Local-First**: All your notes are stored directly on your device in your browser's IndexedDB. They are never sent to or stored on any external servers.
- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, track, or share any personal information or note content.
- **WebAuthn**: The "App Lock" feature uses the WebAuthn standard, meaning your cryptographic keys are stored securely in your device's hardware. We never have access to them.
- **Analytics**: No analytics or tracking scripts are used in this application.

Your notes are yours and yours alone.
